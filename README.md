# IMEXHUB
Our goal is to support businesses and charities that lack the technical resources to work with multiple sources of data efficiently. Without us they either struggle with a manual, repetitive process, or use a third party software vendor and pay transaction based subscription fees. We offer either a one-off implementation cost, or a free “do it yourself” option.


## WHO’S IT FOR?
- Organisations looking to automate the inefficient repetitive work necessary to bridge the gap between systems

- Professionals wanting to learn/retrain, while solving real life problems with the structure and support to create, showcase and scale their solution


## WHY OPEN SOURCE?
- Common features required across data connection/transformation projects make solutions that were previously uneconomical to develop from scratch (for charities/SMEs) more likely to be created

- Wide variety of input and output systems with a need for connection, such as invoices/apps/reports/document management systems


## WHAT CAN IMEXHUB DO?
We're excited that the first iteration of IMEXHUB is already helping two organisations with their business admin processes:

- A CHARITY uses IMEXHUB to build custom reports for a self-managed invoicing process
    - MONTHLY REPORTS PROCESSED SINCE AUGUST 2020 - Less customer questions for improved satisfaction ratings
    - 100+ HOURS SAVED ACROSS 3 TEAMS (PER REPORT) - High employee and volunteer morale working with accurate data
    - 2,000+ LINES OF DATA PROCESSED IN 12 SECONDS - Increased funds with reliable account management

- STATEMENTREADER (our sibling product) uses IMEXHUB to convert multi currency PayPal CSV data into Quickbooks
    - LOCAL DATA PROCESSING - No third party API authorisation required, no loss of your customer data, no data limits
    - USER STAYS IN CONTROL - See the transactions in Excel before uploading to Quickbooks
    - FREE - Completely:) The closest comparison product costs £hundreds each year to process more than 100 transactions per month

## WHAT'S NEXT?

- Create documentation for developers to contribute and for clients to implement the application

- User tutorials

- Critique, prioritise and add new features/product refinements:
    - Email (input)
    - PDF QR code (input)
    - Duplicate transactions (process)
    - PDF text parser (input)
    - Schedule imports
    - Schedule exports
    - Renderui to reset fileInput on import file
    - Document history log
    - User settings window
    - Display whether import is already exported in overview table
    - SEO analysis for feature list and homepage optimisation
